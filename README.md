# INTRODUCTION TO CNN 

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model designed to process and analyze visual data, such as images or videos. It leverages convolutional layers to automatically detect patterns, such as edges or textures, by applying filters to the input data. These filters help extract hierarchical features from low-level (edges, colors) to high-level (shapes, objects). CNNs typically include pooling layers for downsampling and reducing spatial dimensions, and fully connected layers at the end for classification or regression tasks. Thanks to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies, CNNs are particularly powerful for image recognition, object detection, and other computer vision tasks.
